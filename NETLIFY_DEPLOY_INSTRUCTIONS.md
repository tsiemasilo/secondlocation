# 🚀 Netlify Deployment - Ready to Deploy!

## ✅ Issue FIXED!

The pnpm lockfile has been **completely regenerated** and is now in sync with package.json. 
The build has been **tested successfully** and works perfectly!

## 📝 IMPORTANT: Commit These Changes First

Before deploying, make sure to **commit and push the new lockfile**:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml netlify.toml vite.config.ts .env.example
git commit -m "fix: regenerate pnpm lockfile for Netlify deployment"
git push
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables in Netlify
